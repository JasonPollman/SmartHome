#SmartHome API
###Instructions:
  * Install **nmap**.
  * Ensure that **nmap** exists in your PATH variables.

**Then run:**
  > $ cd path/to/this/repository     
  > $ npm install
  
**And to start the API:**
  > $ sudo node index.js
  
  **Note: You must use the 'sudo' command (Unix), or be an administrator (Win)... otherwise you can't access MAC Addresses and the program will fail, since I haven't handled that yet.**
